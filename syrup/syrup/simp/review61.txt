This paper continues a work started 2 years ago by the authors: improving and sudying heuristics of CDCL solvers using machine learning.

Authors proposes a new objective, called Global Learning Rate. They show the correlation between GLR and LBD. Even if it seems obvious afterward: with less decisions per conflict, we can expect to have less decisions in general (a lower search tree), and then clauses with shorter LBD.  By the way, GLR is a good metric that can give new insights to researchers and help them to improve their SAT solver.

The paper is well written, the bibliography is complete. All experiments are explained carefully. Furthermore, authors propose a new heuristic, infeasible in practice, but provide a fair explanation and comparison.

Then, they provide an approximation of this heuristic with interesting results.

To conclude, I think this paper can be accepted.
